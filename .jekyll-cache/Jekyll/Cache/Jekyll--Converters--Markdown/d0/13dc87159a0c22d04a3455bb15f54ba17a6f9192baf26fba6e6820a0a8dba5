I"X<p>We propose a Knowledge Management Framework based on NLP techniques that would tackle challenges such as resource-intensive nature, lack of comprehensive information sources, and overlapping jurisdictions in policy analysis. The framework is designed to be platform-, language- and policy-agnostic. To classify financial incentives in restoration policies, both Sentence-BERT and Cross-Encoders performed well. For sentence classification inference with Sentence-BERT, a random forest classifier can be used to assign a category to a given sentence using the Sentence-BERT learned embeddings.</p>
